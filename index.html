    <p>Luke, we're ready for takeoff. Good luck, Lando When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine. Princess, we'll find Han. I promise. Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you. Ow!</p>

    <p>Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!</p>

    <p>No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!</p>
